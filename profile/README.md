TransitionZero is a climate tech non-profit established in 2021. We provide accessible and open software and data for energy systems modelling. We are entirely grant-funded by the Growald Climate Fund, Google.org, Sequoia Climate Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and European Climate Foundation, among others. 
As a grant-funded start-up, our software, data and insights support mission-aligned partners and organisations working towards cleaner, more reliable energy systems around the world. We're a founding member of the [**ClimateTRACE coalition**](https://climatetrace.org/), providing heavy industry and power system emissions data.

## Our work

- **Software**: We've built Scenario Builder, our free no-code platform for power systems modelling: [**Scenario Builder**](https://www.transitionzero.org/products/scenario-builder). The platform allows modellers to create long-term capacity expansion and short-term hourly dispatch models for a wide range of countries in a no-code interface to inform energy transition decision-making. We've also built our version of the popular OSeMOSYS framework for long-term capacity expansion modelling: [**TZ-OSeMOSYS**](https://github.com/transition-zero/tz-osemosys/). 
- **Data**: We've built open-access datasets for tracking solar PV growth, assessing the viability of early coal retirement in Southeast Asia, and tracking global steel production costs. Check out our flagship data product, [**Solar Asset Mapper (TZ-SAM**)](https://www.transitionzero.org/products/solar-asset-mapper/), an open-access, global database of solar PV assets, derived through planetary-scale machine learning.
- **Insights**: Our analysis team publish regular explainers and regional updates on the energy transition. [**Discover our latest work.**](https://www.transitionzero.org/insights/).
