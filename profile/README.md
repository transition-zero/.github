TransitionZero builds tools and datasets to deliver a net-zero energy future.

## Our Work

- We are a founding member of the [ClimateTRACE](https://www.climatetrace.org/) coalition, delivering new asset-level transparency for global greenhouse gas emissions.
- We develop [ground-breaking](https://carbontracker.org/reports/nowhere-to-hide/) [approaches](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2020/11) for estimating facility-level greenhouse gas emissions from earth observation imagery.
- We use these methods to analyse decarbonisation of the heavy industry and power sectors worldwide, with special reports on the [EU](https://www.transitionzero.org/reports/ripe-for-closure), [China](https://www.transitionzero.org/reports/turning-the-supertanker), and [Japan](https://www.transitionzero.org/reports/advanced-coal-in-japan).
- We publish tools for decision-makers supported by our data and analysis:
  - the [**Coal Asset Transition Tool**](https://www.transitionzero.org/coal-asset-transition-tool), to help refinance and replace coal plants in an affordable and just way
  - the [**Coal-to-Clean Carbon Price Index**](https://www.transitionzero.org/coal-to-clean-carbon-price-index) to track the carbon price required for fuel switching from coal to renewables
  - the [**Global Steel Cost Tracker**](https://www.transitionzero.org/global-steel-cost-tracker) to estiamte steel plant production costs.

We are building a new **Future Energy Outlook** with unprecedented spatial granularity to provide a long-term view of the changing energy system. Our outlook will be open-source and open-data, providing a central resource for deliberation over the future of the energy system.
