TransitionZero is a climate analytics non-profit established in 2021. We build accessible and open software for energy system modelling, and publish regular updates and explainers on the global energy transition. We are entirely grant-funded by the Quadrature Climate Foundation, Google.org, Sequoia Climate Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and European Climate Foundation, among others. 
As a grant-funded start-up, our software, data and insights support mission-aligned partners and organisations working towards cleaner, more reliable energy systems around the world. We're a founding member of the [**ClimateTRACE coalition**](https://climatetrace.org/), providing heavy industry and power system emissions data.

## Our work

- **Software**: We want energy system modelling insights to be accessible to a wider-range of stakeholders. We're developing modern interfaces for interacting with system models, including a no-code UI that allows analysts to create and compare custom capacity expansion or dispatch scenarios. Take a look at our version of the popular OSeMOSYS framework for long-run capacity expansion modelling: [**TZ-OSeMOSYS**](https://github.com/transition-zero/tz-osemosys/). 
- **Data**: We've built open-access datasets for tracking solar PV growth, assessing the viability of early coal retirement in Southeast Asia, and tracking global steel production costs. Check out our flagship data product, [**Solar Asset Mapper (TZ-SAM**)](https://www.transitionzero.org/products/solar-asset-mapper/), an open-access, global database of solar PV assets, derived through planetary-scale machine learning.
- **Insights**: Our analysis team publish regular explainers and regional updates on the energy transition. [**Discover our latest work.**](https://www.transitionzero.org/insights/)
